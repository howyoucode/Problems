2. **Age Classification:** Determine if a user is a minor, adult, or senior citizen based on age input.
3. **Leap Year Checker:** Check if a given year is a leap year.
4. **Even or Odd Checker:** Determine if an integer is even or odd.
5. **Grade Conversion:** Convert a percentage score into a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
6. **Largest of Two Numbers:** Find the largest of two numbers.
7. **Largest of Three Numbers:** Find the largest of three numbers.
8. **Palindrome Check:** Check if a given string is a palindrome.
9. **Triangle Validity Checker:** Determine if three given side lengths form a valid triangle.
10. **Vowel or Consonant:** Identify if a character is a vowel or consonant.
11. **Multiple of 3 and 5:** Check if a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
12. **Temperature Categorization:** Classify temperature in Celsius as freezing, moderate, or hot.
13. **Basic Calculator:** Perform a basic arithmetic operation based on user input.
14. **Century Year Check:** Determine if a year is a century year.
15. **Range Check:** Check if a number is within a specified range.
16. **Triangle Type Classification:** Classify a triangle as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
17. **Divisibility Check:** Check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or both.
18. **Pass or Fail:** Determine if a userâ€™s score is a pass or fail (50 or above).
19. **String Case Check:** Identify if a string is uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.
20. **Prime Number Check:** Check if a given number is prime.
